# Sidejobs
This repository contains a static website for connecting job seekers with potential jobs.
# Origin story
The initial version was a wordpress website which was hosted on aws using opsworks. The project was stalled due to absence of commitment from the founders. To preserve the work done, the frontpage was dumped using chromes special save function and hossted on heroku.
# The Future
The goal is to revive this project and use firebase as a backing store for this work. I still believe Nigeria needs the solution and one day, will complete it
